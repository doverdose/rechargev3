===========

ReCharge Health app with MongoDB, Express, Bootstrap. Testing with Mocha.

Server will be running on port `8080`, by default.

	http://localhost:8080/

## Development

	npm run-script dev

**It's very important that you do all the development in the `/app` folder. Don't touch anything in the `/public` folder, since everything there is generated by Grunt, from the `/app` folder.**


## Tests

Run tests with:

	npm test

Run `jshint` tests with:

	grunt


## Deployment

Before deploying, make sure to build the latest version with Grunt. This will concatenate the scripts, optimize the images, compile and optimize the Sass, etc.

	grunt build

Run on development server with:

	npm start
