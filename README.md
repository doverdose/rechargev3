Recharge v3
===========

ReCharge Health app with MongoDB, Express, Bootstrap. Testing with Mocha.

Server will be running on port `8080`, by default.

	http://localhost:8080/

## Development

	npm run-script dev

**It's very important that you do all the development in the `/app` folder. Don't touch anything in the `/public` folder, since everything there is generated by Grunt, from the `/app` folder.**


## Tests

Run tests with:

	npm test
	

## Deployment

Before deploying, make sure to build the latest version with Grunt. This will run jshint checks, concatenate the scripts, optimize the images, compile and optimize the Sass, etc.

	npm run-script build

Please make sure all jshint checks pass.

Run on development server with:

	npm start
