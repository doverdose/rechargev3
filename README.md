Recharge v3
===========

ReCharge Health app with MongoDB, Express, Grunt, Bootstrap. Testing with Mocha.

Server will be running on port `8080`, by default.

	http://localhost:8080/

## Development

	npm run-script dev

**It's very important that you do all the development in the `/app` folder. Don't touch anything in the `/public` folder, since everything there is generated by Grunt, from the `/app` folder.**


## Tests

Run mocha tests with:

	npm test


## Deployment

Before deployment, run:

	npm run-script production-test

This will run the mocha tests, jshint checks, concatenate the scripts, optimize the images, compile and optimize Sass, and start a Node server for manual testing.

Make sure all tests pass.

Start the Node server with:

	npm start

Make sure you have the NODE_ENV variable set to `development`, `staging` or `production`.
